### ECS Task Definition

These variables are ignored if `task_definition_arn` is set

- `task_cpu` - The number of cpu units used by the task. (used in Fargate)
- `task_memory` - The amount (in MB) of memory used by the task. (used in Fargate)
- `task_network_mode` - The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. ('none', 'bridge', 'awsvpc', 'host')
- `iam_task_role_arn` - The ARN of IAM role of ECS task
- `iam_exec_role_arn` - The ARN of IAM role to execute ECS task
